### In-Progress üöÄ
- [x] ~~Create and integrate Log Class~~
- [ ] Neuron Group Class ( In progress on `nclass` branch)
- [ ] Neuron Types for differentiated functionality (input, output)
- [ ] Possion Process for Neuron Activation
- [ ] Activate Neuron from file inputs (or other arbitrary input)

| Date  | Key Points üîë   |  Issues üêõ   |
|--------------- | --------------- |--------------- |
| [3-11](#-update-3-11)   | Start of Neruon Group Class| None |
| [3-5](#-update-3-5)   | New fully integrated Log class. Write neuron ids and potential values to a `<current_time>.log` file. | None |
| [3-3 pt.2](#-update-3-3-part-2)   | Fixed [Issue 2](#-issue-2)| None |
| [3-3](#-update-3-3)   | Added time stamps to logging messages. Added function descriptions.| None |
| [2-29](#-update-2-29)   | Updated Neuron Class with with membrane potentials, refractory phases, Update to edge weights, fixed issue 1, guard clauses on header files.   | "Quit" functionality does not work for the menu [~~Issue 2~~](#-issue-2)|
| [2-28](#-update-2-28)   | Basic Node class that sends and recieves messages   | `random_neighbors` may repeat edges. [~~Issue 1~~](#-issue-1)|

### üìå Update 3-11
**New addtions:**
- Neuron Group Class
    - Add intergroup and intragroup edges
    - New functions for adding neigbors between groups and within groups
    - New logging functions for reporting group values, state, and grouped neuron interactions
    - Not complete!
        - Unable to send messages
        - Some functions that are aimed to do that, but they are not tested at all
- Some new logging functionality
    - `NeuronGroup` logging; 
    - `DEBUG2` debug level
    - `NeuronGroup` versions of other logging
- Updated makefile
    - To build without groups use the `build1` target (and `run1` target to run)
    - To build with groups use the `build2` target (and `run2` target to run)
### üìå Update 3-5
**New addtions:**
- Fully integrated `Log` class with Debug Level functionality. 
- Collect Neuron ID and Membrane Potential durring execution and write to a `<current_time>.log` file for later use in graphing potential vs time. 
    - Logs are stored in `./logs` 
- Swapped out bare data member refrences with `this->data_member` for readability
- Debug Levels:
    - level is set in `main.cpp:27`
```cpp
enum LogLevel { 
  DATA,
  ERROR,
  WARNING,
  INFO,
  DEBUG,
};
```

##### üêõ ~~Issue 2~~
- I think the quit functionality of the menu sticks executable in a thread lock. Not sure how to fix it.
- I tried
    - Adjusting the mutex positioning to inside the for loop even through it should be on the outside
    - using a pthread barrier to align thread execution before quitting

``` cpp
// main.cpp
while (!finish) {

// sleep for menu timing
    usleep(100000);
    cout << "Activate neuron ( or [-1] to quit )\n";
    for (Neuron *neuron : neurons) {
      cout << " Neuron " << neuron->get_id() << '\n';
    }
    cout << "Input: ";
    cin >> activate;

    if (activate == -1) {
      //locking mutex
      pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex);

      // adjusting variable
      finish = true;
      
      // signaling each neuron to pthread_exit()
      // At this point all neurons should be the in the "waiting state"
      for (Neuron *neuron : neurons) {

        // activate neuron and signal
        neuron->activate();
        pthread_cond_signal(neuron->get_cond());

      }

      // unlock
