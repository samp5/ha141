##### üêõ Issue 2
- I think the quit functionality of the menu sticks executable in a thread lock. Not sure how to fix it.
- I tried
    - Adjusting the mutex positioning to inside the for loop even through it should be on the outside
    - using a pthread barrier to align thread execution before quitting

<details>

``` cpp
// main.cpp
while (!finish) {

// sleep for menu timing
    usleep(100000);
    cout << "Activate neuron ( or [-1] to quit )\n";
    for (Neuron *neuron : neurons) {
      cout << " Neuron " << neuron->get_id() << '\n';
    }
    cout << "Input: ";
    cin >> activate;

    if (activate == -1) {
      //locking mutex
      pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex);

      // adjusting variable
      finish = true;
      
      // signaling each neuron to pthread_exit()
