<summary> Random neighbor function </summary>
<br>

- This funciton still needs adjustments to avoid repeat edges

```cpp
void random_neighbors(vector<Node *> nodes, int number_neighbors) {
  cout << "Adding Random Neighbors\n";
  int size = nodes.size();
  int i = 0;
  while (i < number_neighbors) {
    int from = rand() % size;
    int to = rand() % size;
    if (from == to) {
      continue;
    }
    nodes[from]->add_neighbor(nodes[to], rand() % 5 + 1);
    i++;
  }
}
```

<summary>Basic Node class that can send and recieve messages from other nodes:</summary>
<br>

```cpp
class Node {
private:
  double accumulated = 4;
  int id;
  std::map<Node *, double> neighbors;
  pthread_t thread;
  pthread_cond_t cond;
  bool active = false;
  bool recieved = false;

public:
  Node(int _id) : id(_id) {}
  ~Node();
  void add_neighbor(Node *neighbor, double weight);
  void *run();
  void start_thread();
  void join_thread();

  void activate() { active = true; }
  void deactivate() { active = false; }

  //>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Access to private variables <<<<<<<<<<<
  pthread_cond_t *get_cond() { return &cond; }
  int get_id() { return id; }
  double get_accumulated() { return accumulated; }
